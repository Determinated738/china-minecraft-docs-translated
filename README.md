# China Minecraft Docs Translated

## Q: What is this?

A: This repository contains an AI-translated version of the original Minecraft China (NetEase Edition) documentation. The Chinese docs are known for their extensive and detailed coverage of Minecraft mechanics, modding systems, custom models, and game features.

## Q: What is the point?

A: Chinese Minecraft has produced high-quality documentation. However, these resources are largely inaccessible to non-Chinese speakers. This project brings those good resources to a wider audience by translating them in English.

## Q: Where can I find the original docs?

A: You can access the original NetEase Bedrock documentation from the following sources:

- **Direct Download:** [doc4.zip](https://g79.gdl.netease.com/doc4.zip)
