# 【Star Tutorial Award】Teach you how to customize 3D armor tutorial 

Armor is an important part of the combat system of Minecraft. A set of shiny armor adds a lot to a complete mod. This tutorial will teach you how to make custom 3D armor, not 3D armor. The steps are divided into 3 steps: ① Create armor items ② Customize armor properties ③ Customize armor models. Most of the armor in mods on the market are flat. This video will break the monotony and customize the armor you want. Whether it is cyberpunk style or European plate armor style, what you want is what you get!
