# [Star Tutorial Award] Custom Block Model Tutorial 
This video will teach you how to use mcstudio, a powerful visualization tool, to create a block of your own. The steps are divided into 4 steps: ① Create a block item ② Customize the properties of the block ③ Customize the block texture ④ Customize the block model. The first two steps are relatively simple, and the core of the tutorial is mainly the latter. The block item is what the player holds in his hand. A custom block has properties such as hardness, explosion resistance and light absorption. The difference between the third step and the fourth step is that the third step only modifies the block texture. In fact, the default cube model is used, while the fourth step turns the cube into a polyhedron model created by ourselves.
