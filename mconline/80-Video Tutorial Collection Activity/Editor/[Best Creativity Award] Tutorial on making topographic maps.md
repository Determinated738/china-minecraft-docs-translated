# [Best Creative Award] Terrain Map Making Tutorial 
This video explains the terrain editing function of MCstudio in detail and shows adventurers how to make terrain. The video is divided into two parts: the first part is the explanation of the terrain editing function, which helps adventurers to have a deeper understanding of the six functions of uplift, erosion, filling, smoothing, top cover and plants through a detailed introduction to the terrain editing function; the second part is the actual teaching of terrain development. After learning the terrain editing function in the first part, the video will lead adventurers step by step to make a mountain and consolidate what they have learned through actual combat.
