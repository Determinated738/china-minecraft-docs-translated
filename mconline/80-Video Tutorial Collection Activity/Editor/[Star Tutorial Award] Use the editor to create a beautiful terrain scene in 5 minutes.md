# [Star Tutorial Award] Use the editor to make a beautiful terrain scene in 5 minutes 

Putting together beautiful terrains just right is an exquisite scene map. If you place blocks directly in the game to piece together the terrain, it will take a lot of time and energy. If you are not satisfied with something, you have to modify it repeatedly. Using "Minecraft Editor" will be very simple and efficient. This video Pudding will teach you how to use terrain tools to make beautiful scenes!
