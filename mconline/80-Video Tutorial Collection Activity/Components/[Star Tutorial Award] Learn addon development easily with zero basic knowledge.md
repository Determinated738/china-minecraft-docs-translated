# [Star Tutorial Award] Take you to easily learn addon development from 0 basis 
This tutorial is very suitable for 0-based players or non-behavior pack developers as the first tutorial for getting started with behavior pack development. Through a simple case, you can easily understand the structure of component biological behavior. And the tutorial carefully explains how to use the official original components to study and learn to make the functions you want when you encounter functions that you donâ€™t know how to write, which is very helpful for beginners to learn by themselves. I hope this tutorial can open up the learning path of behavior pack development for you!
