# [Star Tutorial Award] Teach you to develop new creatures that can teleport 
This video aims to convey a concept, that is: making a module is like building a building. Use the official MC Studio to build the foundation (basic framework) of the building, and other tools such as Blockbench and Bridge are responsible for perfecting the decoration of the building. And the threshold for using these tools is not very high, you just need patience and perseverance. Finally, welcome to search in the Minecraft Resource Center: Youda Yoda. Looking forward to your visit~
