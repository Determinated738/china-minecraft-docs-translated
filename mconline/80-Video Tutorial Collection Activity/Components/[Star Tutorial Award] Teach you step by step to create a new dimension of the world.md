# [Star Tutorial Award] Teach you how to create a new dimension of the world 

The original MC only has these three dimensions: the main world, the netherworld, and the end of the world, but if you want to explore a world completely different from these three, itâ€™s not that difficult! In this video, Pudding will teach you how to use the "Minecraft Editor" to create a new dimension. 

This video is provided by [Fruit-flavored Pudding], the winner of the Star Tutorial Award in the [Game Development Tutorial Video Collection Activity].
