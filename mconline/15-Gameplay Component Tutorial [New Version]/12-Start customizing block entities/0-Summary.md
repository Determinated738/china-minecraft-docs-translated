# Summary 

In this chapter, we will learn how to make **Block Entity** (also known as **Tile Entity**) and understand this powerful and practical function, so that our custom blocks have richer features. 

- In the first section (*Understanding Block Entity*), we will learn what Block Entity is, the necessity of Block Entity and how to use it. 
- In the second section (*Understanding Block Entity Appearance*), we will touch the appearance of Block Entity and understand how Block Entity has a custom appearance. 
- In the third section (*Make a speed-up torch*), we will make a speed-up torch for demonstration and use the module SDK to add functions to the block entity. 
- In the last section (*Challenge: Make a custom box (no storage version)*), we will do a challenge together to make a box with only appearance but no storage interface.
