# Summary 

In this chapter, we will learn how to make **JSON UI** and how to cooperate with JSON UI and module API. 

- In the first section (*Understanding and Creating JSON UI*), we will learn what JSON UI is and how to create a **Screen** of JSON UI. 
- In the second section (*Drawing an interface for a custom box*), we will use the editor's interface editor to draw an interface for our previous unstorable custom box, and use the module SDK to display it in the game. 
- In the third section (*Challenge: Designing a box lock*), we will work together to achieve a challenge and make a fully functional box lock for the box.
