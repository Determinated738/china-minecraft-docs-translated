# Summary 

We have learned about **Particle** and **Particle Emitter** in Chapter 2, and learned that the international version of particles and the Chinese version of particle effects and sequence frames are two different systems based on the same underlying layer. In this chapter, we will use the web application **Snowstorm** that we have recommended to make international version custom particles. 

- In the first section (*Start making snow particles*), we will learn to make a snowflake particle together, and learn the use of Snowstorm and the composition of particle JSON files through the production of snowflake particles. 
- In the second section (*Start making particles with flipbook animation*), we will learn to make a loading halo together. Through the production of the loading halo, we will understand the production of an international version of dynamic particles similar to the Chinese version of sequence frame special effects - **Flipbook Animation** particles. 
- In the third section (*Use Molang to increase particle dynamics*), we will learn how to use Molang to add more functions to particles. 
- In the fourth section (*Understand particle events*), we will master the definition and triggering of events through the study of events. 
- In the last section (*Challenge: Design a firework particle*), we will take on a challenge together to make a firework particle.
