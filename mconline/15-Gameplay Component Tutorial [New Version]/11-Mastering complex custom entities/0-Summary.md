# Summary 

In this chapter, we will learn about **Molang** in more detail, understand the application of Molang in entities, and practice Molang in entities together. 

- In the first section (*Understanding Molang*), we will learn about Molang together and understand the lexical, structure, and basic usage of the Molang language. 
- In the second section (*Common scenarios of Molang in custom entities*), we will learn about the application of Molang in entities together and understand the application scenarios of Molang. 
- In the third section (*Using the configuration function to create a basic entity*), we will use the editor to create a basic squirrel entity as a demonstration entity for Molang learning. 
- In the fourth section (*Customize squirrel entity resources*), we will use Molang to customize squirrel resources. 
- In the fifth section (*Customize squirrel entity behavior*), we will define the behavior of the squirrel together. 
- In the sixth section (*Combining entity animation with behavior*), we will combine entity animation and behavior to make a squirrel attack animation. 
- In the seventh section (*Linking biological events and behaviors*), we will combine entity events and behaviors to make an escape mechanism. 
- In the last section (*Challenge: Make a kart*), we will take on a challenge to make a kart.
