# Exporting components from the editor 

Exporting components is also an essential part of development that developers should learn. We have multiple ways to export components. 

## Export as a resource package 

Open the editor and click "Export" in the "Resource Management" pane to export the component as a resource package in the file format of `.mep`.

The resource package exported in this way can be merged and imported in another add-on component through the "Import" function in the same location. 

## Overall export 

Find the work in the Minecraft development workbench. Right-click or click the "More" button and click "Export" or "Export (with edit information)" in the expanded menu.

This will export the entire package as a `.zip` file. Files exported in this way can be re-imported as a component in the Minecraft Development Workbench using the "Local Import" function.
