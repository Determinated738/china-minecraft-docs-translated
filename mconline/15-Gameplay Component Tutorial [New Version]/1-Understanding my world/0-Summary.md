# Summary 

In this chapter, you will learn about the basic concepts of Minecraft. This will help you better understand the game Minecraft in the subsequent development process and write excellent modules. 

- In the first section (*Chunks, Worlds, and Archives*), you will learn about the basic composition of a **World** in Minecraft, and understand that a world is composed of **Chunks**, and chunks are composed of **Blocks**. 
- In the second section (*Entities, Creatures, and Projectiles*), you will learn that the **Mobs** in this world actually belong to a broader category - **Entity**, and that **Projectile** is actually an entity.
