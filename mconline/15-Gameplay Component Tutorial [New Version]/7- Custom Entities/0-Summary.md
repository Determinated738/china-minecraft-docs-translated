# Summary 

In the next chapter, we will learn how to customize entities. Make full use of the third-party tool Blockbench to customize a new entity. The complete demo link of the entity can be downloaded [here](https://g79.gdl.netease.com/addonguide-8.zip). 

- In the first section (*Use Blockbench to modify the geometry model of the chicken*), we will learn how to use Blockbench to modify a model, in other words, to make a **Geometry**. 
- In the second section (*Drawing duck textures for models on Blockbench*), we will continue to use Blockbench to "color" our geometric model, that is, to make the **texture** of this geometry. 
- In the third section (*Exploring the resource control of entities*), we will further explore the resource package of our newly created entity, learn the entity's **definition**, **animation**, **sound effects** and **Animation Controller** and **Render Controller**. 
- In the fourth section (*Exploring the behavior file of the entity*), we will explore the behavior package of the entity and understand the entity's **description**, **component**, **component group** and **event**. 
- In the fifth section (*Adding sound effects to entities*), we will add sound effects to our newly defined entities. 
- In the sixth section (*Let the entity float on the water*), we will add behavior components to our entities. 
- In the seventh section (*Adding particles to the entity*), we will add particle effects to this new entity. 
- In the last section (*Challenge: Custom water mount*), we will complete a challenge together to make our entity a water mount.
