# Theme Outlook: My Seaside Farm 

My Seaside Farm is a gameplay map that aims to strengthen the farm management elements of Minecraft. Players will play the role of young people in Tata Village who are about to cross the coming-of-age ceremony and build a farm resort for the village on a seaside island. **The goal of the game** is to earn 500,000 gold coins within 100 days and decorate at least 12 types of furniture to pass the level. 

Based on this clearance background, we have expanded the gameplay process and art materials. 

## Gameplay Process 

- **Guide Level** 
- Talk to family NPCs to introduce the game background. 
- Players need to understand what they need to do next through multiple resource collection mini-games. You cannot leave the island if you have not completed the task. 
- After completing the task, board the boat at the dock to leave the island, providing a mobile transition and increasing the player's sense of immersion. 

- **Summary of process one** 
- After arriving at the island, the player will see a deserted farm. The small house and the livestock farm need materials or funds to repair. The **recycling box** next to the small house can recycle agricultural crops and obtain development funds. 
- Players need to repair the farm house first. The repair materials can be collected from the deserted farmland. Wood and stone. The remaining materials can be put into the **recycling box** and recycled by merchants to obtain initial funds. 
- The **recycling box** contains basic tools, which do not lose durability and will not be recycled by merchants. If the player does not make any progress (for example, he does not pick up the equipment in the box), the recycling merchant will prompt. 

- **Summary of process two** 
- After using the settlement funds to buy seeds at the seed store, you can sow in the field. 
- Get more funds by sowing seeds and recycling crops to expand the scale of agriculture. 

- **Summary of Process 3** 

- The agricultural scale is further expanded, and 5,000 gold coins and one day are used to repair the livestock farm. 
- Players can raise animals in the livestock farm to create additional profits. 

- **Summary of Process 4** 

- Buy personalized outfits in the clothing store and dress up the most shining self. 
- Buy furniture in the furniture store to decorate the hut and complete the goal of collecting all furniture. 
- Complete the goal of 500,000 gold coins through animal husbandry and planting.
