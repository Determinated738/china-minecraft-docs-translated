# Points to note when playing the map 

Since Minecraft is a game that can change the environment at will and has creative functions. In order to ensure the player experience, especially in a multiplayer environment. It is recommended that you reasonably switch the mechanism rules of the map according to the specific gameplay. If the command block is used, it is also necessary to place the command block in a hidden position. At the same time, controlling the controllability of player activities and providing a novice guide is also an option that can add points to the map. 

## Controllability of player activities 

When players easily break obstacles or destroy map structures, it is easy to make the gameplay experience in the setting very unstable. Using the **Adventure Mode** that comes with Minecraft can prevent players from destroying and placing any blocks, so as to avoid damaging the gameplay map or maliciously destroying the gaming experience of others. 

At the same time, most map terrains will present three states, the original natural biome generation, super flat, or void. In order to prevent players from leaving the activity area, using barrier blocks to wrap the building terrain into a vacuum state can prevent players from losing their direction. 

Finally, there are some entities or creatures in the world that have the ability to destroy blocks. Such as creepers, exploding TNT, and fireballs. Use the following commands to easily prohibit them from destroying terrain in the Bedrock Edition world. 

``` 
/gamerule tntexplodes false # Disable TNT explosions 
/gamerule mobgriefing false # Disable entities from destroying blocks 
``` 

## Newbie guide in the game 

When making a map, the author is often in a God's perspective. Many times, the design of the game mechanism will be taken for granted, but if there is no feedback or guidance. It is impossible to tell the player what to do next, which can easily make the player confused, or even qualitatively understand it as a bug and put the blame on the author. Designing a friendly novice guide can greatly reduce the player's difficulty expectations in the early stage, while letting the player understand the gameplay content in advance, grab their attraction, and reduce the difficulty for novices to get started.
