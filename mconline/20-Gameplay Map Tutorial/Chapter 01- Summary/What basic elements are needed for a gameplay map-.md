# What basic elements are needed for a gameplay map 

A gameplay map must have a clear main line, that is, a **core gameplay**. **Core gameplay** is a map author's hope that players can do something from a location and eventually reach a certain goal in this work. For example, you made a decryption map, hoping that players can escape from a space. When the first such idea that comes to your mind makes you excited enough to make a map that highlights your ideas, it is likely to be the **core gameplay** of this map in the future. 

But just like my world is made up of countless blocks, the gameplay map also needs to have a combination of multiple elements to release the greatest attraction. If you make a super flat map without any terrain, and add some command combinations to let players do things that they can't do in the original survival version, it can also attract its own player group. But without a simple manual or guide prompts, it can't attract more players. Make full use of the open elements of Minecraft to make a more playable map. 

## Scene matching elements 

It is a very effective way to infect a player through the atmosphere of the map environment. For example: make a Japanese campus role-playing map gameplay. If you add cherry blossom streets, arcade game halls, and interiors that fill the indoor space on the basis of building a school building, the Japanese atmosphere will come to you. Similarly, in the gameplay map, the scene often not only bears the effect of decoration and beauty, it may also serve as a resource collection point, NPC task point, etc., and become a functional area. 

## Gameplay matching elements 

With the version update, Minecraft has brought more and more mechanisms and production tools for developers to experiment with, and many famous maps have emerged in the community. For example, Skyblock Survival [The Skyblock], Battle Wall [The Walls], etc. They all provide different variations of the core gameplay of Minecraft. Skyblock will allow players to be born on a small island in the sky, relying only on a tree, water and lava to survive, and there are a lot of complex challenges to complete. At the same time, The Walls is a battle royale game inspired by the Hunger Games. These gameplays can easily stimulate players' desire to challenge, and upload their own challenge videos and live videos through social networks to further promote the popularity of the map and achieve better communication effects. 

## Numerical supporting elements 

After establishing the supporting elements of the scene and gameplay, it is often necessary to start building a system feedback layer with numerical output for these rule mechanisms. It helps players find their position in the game. For example, in a combat system, players will obviously get a growth feedback of their abilities, the strength of the enemy and themselves, restraint and being restrained, etc. This part is mainly achieved by numerical supporting gameplay rules. Of course, a reasonable challenge curve can also allow players to find a balance between overcoming difficulties and achieving goals. 

## Clearance Direction 

Having a clear clearance direction can guide players to play the game according to the world rules, synchronizing the player's understanding of the map with the goal of clearing the game, so as not to follow the designer's ideas in the opposite direction. Similarly, the final clearance of the game is achieved by the players, so when you present the ending to the players, you must connect it with the activities that the players have done before and give a good feedback. If the content quality is attractive enough, it is possible for players to continue to play repeatedly in the future.
