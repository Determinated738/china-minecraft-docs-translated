# What is a gameplay map 

A gameplay map is a custom world created by the map author. Through a combination of one or more elements, a game experience different from the original survival is achieved. Such as building terrain, command blocks, particle effects, custom entities, custom UI, etc. They can be exciting role-playing adventures that immerse players in epic stories, or challenging puzzle maps that test players' problem-solving skills. 

The best skill for making maps is empathy. You must build a game model of what the player sees, feels, and thinks. Empathy allows you to design a difficulty curve and know when to give players a break and when to add scenes to surprise them. Empathy is the most powerful way of thinking for players. 

The possibilities of creating maps with Minecraft are endless. The only limit for map creators is imagination. Anyone can create their own gameplay map in Minecraft and share your handmade map with all players through the Minecraft Chinese version developer platform!
