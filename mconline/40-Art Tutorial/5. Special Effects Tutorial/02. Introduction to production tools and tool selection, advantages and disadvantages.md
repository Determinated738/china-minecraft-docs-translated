PS: Photoshop is often used to complete the hand-painting and puzzle steps of 2D special effects. Because Photoshop has its own animation frame rate production, it can be used to produce flat 2D special effects, and it can also be used to produce 3D auxiliary textures. Therefore, it is very suitable for beginners who want a hand-painted style or are not very proficient in editor control. You can use PS for practice and production.
