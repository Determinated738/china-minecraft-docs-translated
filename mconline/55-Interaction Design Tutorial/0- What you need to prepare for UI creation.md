## Prepare tools 

### My World Development Workbench (MC Studio) 

**【Official download address: [https://mc.163.com/dev/](https://mc.163.com/dev/)】** 

This is an auxiliary software that can help us visually edit the game interface. It can import our drawn materials in real time for editing in the software, and directly display many interfaces that could only be adjusted in code or other software in the past in the game interface, so that creators can see the interface effects they have drawn more intuitively.

## Image editing software 


Here we mainly recommend two commonly used software on computers. As for other image processing software, as long as you are used to it, you can use similar software even on your mobile phone to achieve the desired effect. 

### PhotoShop
