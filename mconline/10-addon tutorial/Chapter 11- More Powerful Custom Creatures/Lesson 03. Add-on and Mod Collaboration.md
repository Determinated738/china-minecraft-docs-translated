# Add-on and Mod Collaboration 

#### Author: Boundary 



In the current Chinese version, there are multiple ways to make MOD and add-on packages work together. 

①Use GetEntitiesAround to pass in a filter to filter out the entities you want within the range. 

②Use TriggerCustomEvent to execute a biological event defined by a biological behavior. 

③Listen to the EntityDefinitionsEventServerEvent event to listen to an entity in the game triggering an event. 

④Use GetMolangValue to get the query function value of an entity on the client.
