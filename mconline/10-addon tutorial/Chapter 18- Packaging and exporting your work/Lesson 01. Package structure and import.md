# Package structure and import 



#### Author: Realm 



Package is also called Package. It is a compressed and packaged file by the developer that contains the local JAVA version resource content and the Bedrock version resource content. After the uploaded package is obtained from the Chinese version developer platform, it will be pushed to the public download server after machine review and manual review. Finally, the player downloads the compressed package and decompresses it on the client to play the component resources. 

Before uploading to the platform, the developer should ensure that the content developed locally has achieved the expected running effect. And compress and package it according to the packaging method in this chapter to reduce the probability of rejection or review time of machine review.

![](./images/1_42.jpg) 

![](./images/1_43.jpg) 

2) If the world archive carries additional pack gameplay, please make sure that there are world_behavior_packs.json and world_resource_packs.json files in the archive folder directory. Among them, pack_id corresponds to the uuid under the header in the material pack or behavior pack manifest. Version corresponds to the version under the header in the manifest. If only the material pack or behavior pack is carried, you can clear all the contents in the first square bracket in world_behavior_packs.json or world_resource_packs.json. If you do not carry additional packs, you do not need to carry such files in the archive folder. 

![](./images/1_44.jpg) 

3) Developers can place a server.properties file in the archive to specify the player's game mode. In this way, when playing this online map in the online lobby, the player will enter the game mode set in the server.properties file each time. For more configuration settings of Bedrock Edition multiplayer online maps, please refer to the website [https://minecraft.fandom.com/zh/wiki/Server.properties#.E5.9F.BA.E5.B2.A9.E7.89.88_3](https://minecraft.fandom.com/zh/wiki/Server.properties#.E5.9F.BA.E5.B2.A9.E7.89.88_3)
