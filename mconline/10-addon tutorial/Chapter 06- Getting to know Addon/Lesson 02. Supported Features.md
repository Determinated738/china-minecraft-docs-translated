# Supported Features 

#### Author: Boundary 

Add-ons can do many things. Here we divide the supported features into the following categories: 

① Custom creatures 

② Custom items 

③ Custom blocks 

④ Custom recipes 

⑤ Custom music 

⑥ Custom loot 

⑦ Custom dimensional biomes 

⑧ Custom status effects 

#### Custom creatures 

Creatures include original creatures and original creatures added by developers. 

A creature will at least include a creature egg, a texture map, a geometric model, and several animations. For example, when we encounter a creature chicken in the game, it has yellow feet and a red crown. Its walking and looking performance comes from the moving animation and the animation of looking somewhere. Open the creation backpack and you can see a chicken creature egg. Correspondingly, when adding new custom creatures, these contents can also be customized one by one. 

#### Customized Items 

Generally speaking, items include three types: props, equipment, and weapons and tools. 

In addition to equipment supporting 3D models, in the current version, props and weapons do not support 3D form, and the content that items support customization is relatively limited. Some less common functions, such as supporting items held in the off-hand, or items consumed as arrows, cannot be realized. 

The functions of customizable items are relatively basic. We divide props into the following three categories: general props, functional props, and consumable props. General props are usually used as synthetic consumables of other props, such as the original blaze rod, nautilus, etc., and they are not very useful in hand. Functional props are usually regarded as props that help adventurers survive, such as ender pearls. Consumable props are mainly concentrated on food, such as beef, golden apples, etc. 

Custom equipment supports setting four slot types: helmet, armor, leggings, and shoes, and also supports setting corresponding defense and enchantment levels. 


Customized weapons and tools support ranged weapons, hoes, pickaxes, shovels, axes, and melee weapons. For weapons and tools, you can also set the level and speed of the tool, and for melee weapons, you can also set the damage of the weapon. 

#### Custom blocks 

Custom blocks are new blocks that inherit some of the functions of the original blocks and can be customized by developers. 

Since the blocks in "Minecraft" have many features and will add more new features with version updates, the functions of most blocks cannot be added to custom blocks. In the Chinese version, in addition to being able to customize simple single-grid blocks, developers can also customize models, collision boxes, and functions of some special functional blocks through the efforts of the Flower Group. 

#### Custom recipes 

The custom recipe function allows developers to customize the synthesis of workbench recipes, furnace recipes, brewing stand recipes, stonecutter recipes, etc., but currently the furnace recipe does not support experience gain, so please pay attention. 

#### Custom Music 

Custom music means that developers can put music files with file suffixes of ogg or wav into the add-on package, and present a more unique and wonderful music experience for adventurers through physical creatures, background music, music commands, etc. 

#### Custom Loot 

The custom loot function allows developers to modify the treasure chests, drops of biological blocks, or fishing rewards in the world. 

#### Custom Dimension Biomes 

Custom Dimension Biomes allow developers to add additional dimensions in addition to the main world, the netherworld, and the end. At the same time, custom biomes can create a more unique ecological appearance for adventurers, greatly enhancing the game experience. 

#### Custom Status Effects 

Custom status effects allow developers to increase, gain, and reduce buff effects for adventurers through cooperation with MODSDK.
