# Get to Know Add-on 
#### Author: Realm 

Add-on is a solid step towards full customization of Minecraft, and it is officially supported by Mojang AB and Microsoft. 

The current version allows adventurers to change their worlds, and these functions can be achieved through resource packs and behavior packs. Unlike traditional scripting and programming methods to modify game content, add-on packs provide a more easy-to-understand and flexible combination method. It uses JSON, a data exchange format language, and to some extent, it does not have the characteristics of a complete programming language, so developers need to master fewer knowledge points and fewer keywords to understand. 

The real power of add-on packs lies in the fact that they reduce the programming requirements for developers and provide customization content far beyond previous Minecraft versions. 
In this charter, developers will be guided to have a preliminary understanding of what add-on packs can do for our creativity.
