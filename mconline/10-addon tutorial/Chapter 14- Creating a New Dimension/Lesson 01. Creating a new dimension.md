# Create a new dimension 



#### Author: Boundary 



Dimension is the area where players live in Minecraft. Minecraft has three dimensions: the Main World, the Nether, and the End. They have different landforms, biological distributions, and characteristic rules. In the current Chinese version, we can use add-ons to add new dimensions, change the landforms and characteristic distributions of the biomes in the new dimensions to customize a new gameplay experience. It should be noted that custom biomes are currently bundled with custom dimensions. If developers want to add or modify the biomes in the Main World, they need to turn on experimental gameplay to use them, and experimental gameplay will bring unstable factors. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to give custom biomes to the new dimensions.
