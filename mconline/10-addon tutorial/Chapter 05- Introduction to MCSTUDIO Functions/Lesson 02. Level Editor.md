# Level Editor 

#### Author: Realm 

The level editor is the center for configuring and managing add-ons. It can customize dimensions, creatures, items, blocks, recipes, and other content. By combining these game elements, you can form your own unique gameplay. 

For developers at different stages, the recommended way to use the level editor is also different. 

Novice stage: Build gameplay through components and become familiar with various custom game elements. 

Experienced stage: Understand the file structure of Addon through the resource management of the level editor, study the functional implementation principle of components, and try to make some file-level modifications based on components. 

Expert stage: Use the level editor to quickly build a gameplay prototype, and then make in-depth file modifications.
