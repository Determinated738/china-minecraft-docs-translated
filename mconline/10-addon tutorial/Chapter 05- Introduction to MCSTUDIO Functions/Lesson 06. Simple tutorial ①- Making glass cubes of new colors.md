# Simple tutorial ①: Make a glass block of a new color 
#### Author: Realm 

① Switch the current editor to the level editor. If the interface is already in the level editor, you can skip this operation. 

② Right-click in the component panel to add a block component and set the rendering material to translucent. 

③ Import the new color glass map through the common directory textures\blocks under "Resource Management", right-click to import the file, and import the map into the blocks folder. 

④ Drag the glass texture from "Resource Management" to the upper block texture, lower block texture, and side block texture of the "Property Bar" model and texture. Use the default attribute values for other attributes. 

⑤ Click the placement button on the right side of the custom block component to unlock the placement operation. If a pop-up window prompts that you need to refresh the game, click Reload. 

⑥ Finally, click the "Run" button in the upper right corner of the editor, and you can find the custom block you just added in the game's creative mode building category.
