The specific usage method has been introduced in the [previous section](./1-My World Original Command.html#Relative Coordinates)

The effect in the above picture is achieved using the command `/summon lightning_bolt ~ ~ ~`. 

Usage 

``` 
summon <entityType: EntityType> [spawnPos: x y z] [spawnEvent: string] [nameTag: string] 
``` 

```

summon <entityType: EntityType> <nameTag: string> [spawnPos: x y z] 
``` 

## /execute 

`/execute` can execute another command while changing the executor, execution position and angle, adding restrictions, and storing its output value. 

Usage 

``` 
execute <origin: target> <position: x y z> <command: command> 
``` 

You can limit the execution of a command only when the specified block is detected: 

``` 
execute <origin: target> <position: x y z> detect <detectPos: x y z> <block: Block> <data: int> <command: command> 
``` 

For example, if we need to detect a creeper and generate lightning at its location, we can use the following command. 

`/execute @e[type=creeper,c=1] ~ ~ ~ summon lightning_bolt ~ ~ ~` 

![](./images/15.png) 

You can see that a lightning bolt is summoned at the location of the creeper, turning it into a lightning creeper.
