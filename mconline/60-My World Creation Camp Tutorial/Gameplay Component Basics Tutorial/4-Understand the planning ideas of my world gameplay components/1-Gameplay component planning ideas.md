# Gameplay Component Planning Ideas 

Before we start making a gameplay component, we need to have some thoughts on the gameplay of this gameplay component, which is called formulating requirements. 

After formulating the requirements, we will have a clearer idea when making gameplay components and improve the efficiency of production to a certain extent.

## Requirements Formulation 

To make a gameplay component, we need to formulate the following requirements. 

- General gameplay 
- Items 
- Blocks 
- Entities 
- Interaction logic 
- UI 

After formulating these requirements, we will have a general framework for the gameplay components that need to be made, and we can get some useful information from this plan. 

For example, what textures, models, and animations need to be made? What blocks, items, and entities need to be configured? What is the logical relationship between each block and item, and how to set the synthesis formula? 

With these basic analyses, you can be more clear about what you need to do in each piece when making it. If it is a team development, the division of labor between team members can be clearer, and the art, technology, and planning can each perform their duties, and at the same time, they can carry out their own work in an orderly manner, and finally gather them together to form a complete gameplay component. 

> When formulating requirements, you must recognize your own development capabilities and appropriately add or subtract functions. 
> 
> Requirements that are too difficult will not only make you clueless when making, but also slow down the production progress, resulting in the inability to realize the gameplay. 
> 
> Based on the current development capabilities, you can get a certain sense of accomplishment after completing the game component, thereby stimulating your creative enthusiasm. 

## Time Planning 

Having requirements is not enough. How to allocate development time at each stage is also very important. 

After formulating the requirements, estimate the workload of each part and set an expected duration. 

Reasonable time planning can urge yourself to complete the work within the specified time and effectively prevent procrastination. 

## Homework 

Based on the knowledge you have learned so far, design a game component plan, estimate the workload, and plan the development time.
