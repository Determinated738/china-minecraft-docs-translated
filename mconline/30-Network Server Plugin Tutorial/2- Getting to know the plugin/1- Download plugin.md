Currently, official plug-ins and third-party plug-ins cover most types. Including but not limited to: 

- Chat 
- Tools 
- World management 
- Economy 
- Mechanism 

In the future, the official will continue to upload more official plug-ins, support and cultivate more third-party developers, expand the plug-in library, and lower the threshold for Apollo to open a server.
