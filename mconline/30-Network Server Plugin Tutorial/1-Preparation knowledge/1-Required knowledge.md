# Essential knowledge 
If you have mastered any of the following development skills, mastering Apollo plug-in development will be twice the result with half the effort. 

## Java server plug-in development basics 

Java server plug-in development, that is, using jvm languages such as Java or Kotlin, and using similar servers such as Spigot, to develop gameplay. 

Although the development of the Chinese version of Apollo plug-in is developed using Python, I believe that it will be easier to get started and easier to understand the development logic of Apollo plug-ins if you have mastered the jvm language. 

## Chinese version Mod development 

If you have mastered the Chinese version of Mod development, then learning the development of Apollo plug-ins will be easier. Because the development of Apollo plug-ins is based on ModSDK, a series of server type concepts and dedicated interfaces are added, and a high-performance database backend is provided for data access. The structure of the Apollo framework will be discussed in the following chapters. 

For developers who already know how to write Chinese version Mods, learning Apollo plug-in writing requires more attention to understanding the workflow of server plug-ins.
