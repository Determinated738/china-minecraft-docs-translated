# Developer Level Description 

The new developer level system is a brand new developer growth record system. Compared with the old growth system, the new version divides the system into three modules: 

- **Developer Basic Level**: The developer basic level is upgraded by accumulating experience points and completing assessment tasks. The purchase behavior of players on the platform will be converted into developer experience points. We will gradually cancel the old developer level and developer level privileges (such as diamond pricing and component upload restrictions), and provide developers with a more professional and clear level system in addition to retaining the upgrade message notification and performance review. 
- **Monthly Ability Contribution**: The monthly ability contribution system counts the developer's content contribution on both the mobile version and the computer version on a monthly basis. The final contribution score will be the sum of the two, and the developer will be ranked according to the score. Ranking is an effective benchmark for participating in various platform activities and plans. 
- **Credit Points**: Credit is the foundation for developers to operate sustainably. We attach great importance to the impact of developers' behavior on the platform, players and ecology, and resources will also give priority to platform members with good credit. Developers should consciously abide by the regulations. If the credit points are deducted by the platform, the adverse effects will be borne by the developer himself.

> When the developer encounters the following situations, the **level rollback mechanism** will appear. The mechanism will cause the experience to continue to decrease. When the experience reaches 0, the level will be triggered to drop, but the level after the drop will not be lower than the **current level**. 
> 
> - **No new content has been released for 3 consecutive months**. 
> 
> When the basic level of the developer account enters the **rollback state**, the daily experience rolled back is approximately equal to **1%** of the total level experience. **1 month** before rollback, **starting experience rollback**, **starting level rollback**, the platform will send relevant emails to the developer's **platform mailbox** by default. 

| Behavior | Experience Score | 
| ------------- | -------- | 
| Purchase and Acquisition | 0.1 | 
| For every emerald consumed | 1 | 
| For every diamond consumed | 10 | 

> When players acquire works and consume corresponding diamond/emerald currency, developers will gain corresponding experience points.

| Ability Contribution Achievements | Ability Contribution Value Requirements | 
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | 
| A view of the mountains![](./images/14_1.png) | Top 5% of developers with ability contribution | 
| Take-off time![](./images/14_2.png) | Top 6~20% of developers with ability contribution | 
| Hardworking friends![](./images/14_3.png) | Top 21~50% of developers with ability contribution | 
| Diving in the fish pond![](./images/14_4.png) | Top 51~100% of developers with ability contribution | 
| Lying villagers![](./images/14_5.png) | Developers with no ability contribution and other developers | 

> At the beginning of each month, the developer platform will count the contributions of developers to the platform in components and online games in the previous month, standardize the results, and calculate the data into developer ability contribution points and ability contribution levels. 

| Contribution type | Contribution factor | Contribution description | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |

| Component capability contribution | Number of diamonds in PC resource center revenue | Total new diamond revenue of all PC resource center resources under the developer account in the month | 
| Component capability contribution | Number of diamonds in mobile resource center revenue | Total new diamond revenue of all mobile resource center resources under the developer account in the month | 
| Component capability contribution | Number of good reviews for PC resource center | Actual new ratings of all PC resource center resources under the developer account in the month | 
| Component capability contribution | Number of good reviews for mobile resource center | Actual new ratings of all mobile resource center resources under the developer account in the month | 
| Online game capability contribution | Average daily active users of PC online games | Average daily active users of all PC game centers under the developer account in the month | 
| Online game capability contribution | Average daily active users of mobile online games | Average daily active users of all mobile online games under the developer account in the month | 
| Online game capability contribution | Number of diamonds in PC online game revenue | Number of diamonds in PC game center revenue under the developer account in the month | 
| Contribution value of online game capability | Number of diamonds of mobile online game revenue | Number of diamonds of all mobile online games revenue under the developer account in the current month | 

> The number of newly added positive reviews received by the developer in the current month will have different weighted score bonuses according to the rating level. 

## Developer Credit Points Management Regulations 

| Minimum Credit Points | Maximum Credit Points | 
| ---------- | ---------- | 
| 0 | 12 | 

> Credit points are mainly used to monitor and evaluate the honesty and trustworthiness of developers. The full score is 12 points, the minimum score is 0 points, and the accumulation period of points is 365 days. 

| Penalty Type | Credit Points Deduction | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Class A | 12 points | 
| Class B | 6 points | 
| Class C | 3 points | 

> When a user violates the rules, the user's violation is divided into A, B, and C levels, and 12 points, 6 points, and 3 points are deducted accordingly, until the score is 0. 
> 
> For details on the severity of the penalties for Category A, Category B, and Category C, please refer to <a href="../36-Review and Delisting/Course02-Introduction to Developer Content Review System.html" rel="noreferrer">Developer Content Review System</a>. 

## Developer Level FAQ 

### My developer base level experience points have reached the upgrade conditions for the next level, but have not yet reached the upgrade conditions. Will I continue to gain experience? 

When developers reach the maximum level of the same level, experience points will continue to accumulate. After the level is upgraded, the overflow of additional experience points will be added back to the **developer base level** experience. 

### I violated the triggering regulations and caused the deduction of credit points. Do I still have a chance to remedy it? 

**Credit points will be automatically reset by the system after 365 days**, and during this period, the points cannot be replenished through other measures. 

### What are the uses of my developer credit points and other level contribution points? 

When opening applications for related activities and resource recommendations, the official will screen the qualifications of the developers who have registered, and the three scores will serve as **important reference**. Other functions that will be connected to the developer platform in the future will also be related to them. Developers are requested to cherish their reputation and not lose their credibility or violate discipline.
