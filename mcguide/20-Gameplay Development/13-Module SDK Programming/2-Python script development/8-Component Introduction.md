# <span id="Component Introduction"></span>Component Introduction 

Components are data sets that are used to complete one or more specific logical functions. Components only save data and do not execute corresponding logic. Only when components are updated in the System, the System determines whether the components need to be updated and obtains the data that needs to be updated from the components to execute the corresponding logical functions. 
Components are divided into engine components and custom components. The parameter types and functions of engine components are determined. Players can create Create or obtain Get components to complete logical functions. Custom components require custom component data structures and custom component update logic.
