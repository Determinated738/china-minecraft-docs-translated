**Note:** 

The Chinese version of Minecraft PE currently supports the following game versions: 1.20, 1.19, and 1.18. Version support will change with updates. 

Framework used: Nukkit is commonly used in the market. Minecraft will officially provide the Bedrock Edition C++ development tool Apollo, and the development language is python2.7.15 

Machine specifications: Low-frequency machines have 2 CPUs, each with 20 cores, for a total of 40 cores. Online games usually use low-frequency machines 

Forum/official website address: The address of the page that can display server information. If there is no official website, other information introduction pages can also be used. 

Fill in the other information truthfully. After all the information is filled in, return to the top of the page and click "Save", then click "Submit for Review", and finally wait for review. 

## Submit for review and wait for review results 

After the PE network server application is submitted, the general review period is **15 working days**. Regardless of whether the review is passed or not, the review result will be notified by SMS in the end. 

If the application is approved: the official will issue a **development machine** for building the server. The server owner needs to build the server within **90 days** from the day the server is assigned, and finally wait for the final review and listing on the official server. If it is still not reviewed after **90 days**, the development machine applied for will be automatically recovered. 

If the application is not approved: the server owner needs to modify it before submitting it. Each server owner/team has **3** opportunities to submit PE network servers. If **3** submissions are not approved, they will not be able to submit PE network server applications in the future.
