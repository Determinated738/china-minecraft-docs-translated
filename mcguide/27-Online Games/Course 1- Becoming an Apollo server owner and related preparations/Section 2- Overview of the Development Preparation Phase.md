# Overview of the development preparation phase 

### Preparation phase steps 

​ Step 1: Application for settlement 

​ Step 2: Application for development phase server 

​ Step 3: Link to development phase server 

​ Step 1 is mainly to submit server application materials for settlement evaluation. It is recommended that the information provided by the server owner is as detailed and clear as possible. Step 2 requires the provision of a fixed IP and secret key, and the issued machine is also closely related to these two contents. Step 3 is to successfully link to the server based on the IP and secret key provided above. From then on, the server owner will successfully build a server in the development phase and have the core architecture of the development. For specific step instructions, please refer to the subsequent courses from Section 3 to Section 5.
