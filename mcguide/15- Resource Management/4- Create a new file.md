In addition to creating new files, the New File Wizard also provides: 

- File type description 
- Entity presets, partial configurations, and other selection data templates (as shown below) 
- File naming 
- Creation of supporting files for presets and parts 
- Creation of ModMain script files and supporting files 
- Automatic generation of necessary code in script code files 

Therefore, for file types supported by the New File Wizard, we recommend that you use this method to create new files.
