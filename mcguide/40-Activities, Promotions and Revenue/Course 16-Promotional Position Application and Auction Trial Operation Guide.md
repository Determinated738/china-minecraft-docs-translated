# Promotion Position Application and Bidding Trial Operation Guide 

***Last updated on: 2022/9/28, added mobile version online game carousel application content. *** 

In order to give more developers a platform and opportunity to showcase their works, the developer platform can now directly apply for and bid for mobile and computer version promotion positions. 

By providing an entry on the **【Promotion and Activities】** module on the developer platform, combined with a self-service process, developers can receive the results of promotion position application and bidding more clearly, conveniently and promptly. After this iteration, the top carousel on the mobile version resource center homepage will provide 4 application positions, and the top carousel on the mobile version online game homepage will provide 3 application positions. The **Wonderful World** and **Game Center** of the computer version will provide 5 application positions and 1 bidding position respectively, and the **First Screen Pop-up** of the computer version will provide 4 application positions and 1 bidding position. The promotion types of different platform channels are slightly different. If you want to understand the adjustments in more detail and intuitively, please check the table below: 

| Game platform | Whether the promotion position supports bidding | Whether the promotion position supports application | Number of promotion positions that can be applied for | Promotion positions that can be bid for | Promotion position | Promotion type | 
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | 
| Mobile version | ➖ | ✔️ | 4 | 0 | Resource Center Carousel | Online Games & Resource Components | 
| Mobile version | ➖ | ✔️ | 3 | 0 | Online Game Carousel | Online Games | 
| PC version | ✔️ | ✔️ | 5 | 1 | Wonderful World Carousel | Online Games & Resource Components | 
| PC version | ✔️ | ✔️ | 5 | 1 | Game Center Carousel | Online Games | 
| PC version | ✔️ | ✔️ | 4 | 1 | Launcher first screen pop-up | Online game |

## FAQs about promotion position application and auction 

### Why can't I find the name of the work I want to promote in [Application Content]? 

Answer: At present, the platform has a scoring threshold for the promotion works applied for. Works that do not meet the threshold will not be able to apply for promotion. Please check the table below for the rating threshold: 

| Platform | Work Type | Rating Criteria | 
| ------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------- | 
| Mobile Version | Online Games & Components | Average rating of 4 points or more, at least 50 ratings | 
| Desktop Version | Online Games & Components | More than 100 likes | 

### Why can't I find the corresponding name in [Application Content] even though the work meets the rating threshold? 

Answer: Developers must ensure that the work status is **[Live]** in order to display the corresponding work name in **[Application Content]**. 

### For newly launched online games and components, how can I participate in the promotion position application and bidding function? 

Answer: Newly launched components and online game works will not be restricted by **[Rating Threshold]** within 30 days. Developers can apply for or bid for promotion position resources for new works at any time. When the work has been online for more than 30 days, it will be included in the **[Score Threshold]** standard assessment. If the work indicated that the application is a new component or new server, and can well explain the characteristics, the official will give priority to it when receiving the application submission. 

### Can I apply for and bid for promotion positions at the same time in a single promotion cycle? 

Answer: Yes, developers can participate in both the application and bidding processes of promotion positions in a single promotion cycle. If the same component is selected for application and bidding at the same promotion position, it will be given priority to enter the application process. 

### How many times can I apply for or bid for promotion positions in a single promotion cycle? 

Answer: In a promotion cycle, a developer can apply for up to 5 promotion positions for components and online games in total, and there is no limit on the number of times to bid for promotion positions. 

### How many components and online games can be submitted in a single promotion cycle? 

A: The promotion position bidding and application function does not impose a secondary restriction on the type of works submitted. Therefore, as long as the works meet the **[Rating Threshold]** or **have been online for less than 30 days**, they can be freely combined and submitted. 

### After the application results of the promotion position are announced, can I apply for the next promotion position immediately? 

A: According to the new promotion position application process, developers can apply for promotion resources for multiple display weeks in a row. However, in order to make the promotion position accessible to more developers, the probability of developers who have obtained promotion resources in the past two weeks will be greatly reduced. Please make your own decisions. 

### Why do you need to collect a bidding deposit before participating in the auction? 

A: In order to ensure that developers participating in the auction can pay the auction transaction price as agreed after the auction is successful, you need to pay a bidding deposit of 500 yuan in advance to participate in the auction. You can apply for a refund 30 days after submission. If you have not performed any auction-related actions within 30 days, the refund application will be automatically triggered. **After the refund application is submitted, the bidding deposit will be refunded within 14 working days. ** If the bidding developer fails to pay the transaction price as agreed after the bidding is successful, the deposit will be deducted and the bidding result will be invalidated. In serious cases, the official will permanently cancel the traffic location bidding and application qualifications, and deduct the developer's credit points according to the situation. 

### Why can't I pay the bidding deposit?


Answer: The developer account credit score must be maintained at **6** points, and the ability contribution level must be **【Struggle Old Iron】** or above to pay the auction deposit and obtain the auction qualification.
