# Application for the Chinese version of "Minecraft" PE online game carousel 

### What is a PE online game? 

![](./images/15_1.png) 

PE online games refer to multiplayer game services that developers build through official server resources. Players can click [Online Games] on the mobile terminal to enter. 

Online games remove many restrictions on local connections, allowing players to meet more players with similar interests without being disturbed by time and region factors. 

### Online game carousel 

The carousel is located at the top of the online game page and is used to display games that are **new** or **holding events (including major updates)**.

### Carousel application rules 

#### Recommendation cycle 

The carousel will be displayed from **every Tuesday at 18:00 to next Tuesday at 17:59**, for a total of 7 days. There are a maximum of **3** carousel quotas in each recommendation cycle. 

#### Application deadline 

Server owners can apply at least **3 days** before the start of the recommendation cycle. *For example, for recommendations from 2021.10.19 to 2021.10.26, the application must be submitted before 2021.10.16 18:00 at the latest. * 

#### Application type 

There are two types of carousels for application: new or active. 

In the same recommendation cycle, you can only apply for one type at most. 

1) For each online game, **you can get 1 **new carousel opportunity in your lifetime, and this opportunity must be used within **six months of launch**. If there are other non-new carousel applications during the same period, new games can get the carousel first. 

2) For updates to operational activities, gameplay, game systems, etc., you can apply for activity carousels. After this type of application is successful, there is a **3-week cooling-off period**, and you cannot apply for activity carousels again during the cooling-off period. 


*For example: If the server owner successfully applies for recommendation during 2021.10.19~2021.10.26, he cannot apply for recommendation during 2021.10.26~2021.11.2 and 2021.11.2~2021.11.9. *
