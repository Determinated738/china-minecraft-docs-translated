# "My World" Chinese Version JAVA Online Game Entry Guide 
#### Overview of PC Online Games 
#### What is a PC Online Game? 

![](./images/8_1.jpg) 

PC online games refer to multiplayer game services that developers use official server resources to build gameplay. You can click [Game Center] in the left menu of the client to find the multiplayer server in the online stage. 

Online games remove many restrictions on local connections, allowing players to meet more like-minded players without being disturbed by time and region. 

#### Tools used in online games 

The Chinese version does not provide technical support and technical guidance for the JAVA version of the server development tools. Development enthusiasts can choose third-party stable tools for server development, such as Bukkit, Forge, etc.
