Special effect model preview is used to quickly preview the specified model and the special effects attached to it. Not only that, other models and special effects can also be added to the scene. 

The various parameters are explained as follows: 
- **Shield left button attack**: Used to switch whether to shield Steve's left button attack action.
- **Separation of the main character and the camera**, used to switch whether the camera can view the model in 360Â°. The default game perspective can only view the front or back of the main character, and the perspective is fixed. By turning on the perspective separation, you can view the model more conveniently.

## Preview Model and Special Effects 

After understanding the above preview functions, you can directly add models and special effects to the scene. First, add special effects. Click the + sign on the scene special effect, select the existing fire_buff.json, click Play, and you can see the special effects being rendered in the scene.
