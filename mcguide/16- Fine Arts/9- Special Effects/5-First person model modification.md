# Getting Started Tutorial 05-First Person Model Modification 

This tutorial mainly introduces the following contents: 

1. What is the first person model. 

2. How to modify the first person model. 

The first person model refers to the model in the first person perspective. For Steve, it is equivalent to Steve's arm, but the first person model can be more than just an arm. For example, if the first person model is set to Daitengu, Daitengu will still be rendered in Daitengu's first perspective. 

>The first person model is only supported when the model is a skeletal model, and the first person model also needs to be a skeletal model. So the default Steve does not support the first-person model. 

The steps to modify the first-person model are as follows: 

1. Change the model to the imported skeleton model in the model mounting panel. For the specific import process, please refer to [Model Import](./1-Model Import and Use.md) 

2. Modify the first-person model of the mounting panel, and change this item to the imported first-person model (arm model) 

3. Modify the first-person model action of the mounting panel, and change this item to the corresponding (waving) action 

4. Switch the perspective to the first-person view of the model
