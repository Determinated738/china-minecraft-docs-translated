# 2022.5.10 Version 1.0.6 

## Workbench 

### Editor interface update! 

- We have optimized the visual style of the interface, and the obsidian-like interface brings a more immersive experience. 
- The contrast between text and background has been greatly improved, which can reduce visual fatigue caused by long-term use. 

- The hierarchy of text and background has been optimized, and the rounded corner cards are used appropriately. The relationship between the elements of the interface is clearer, and it is clear to use at a glance.

### New upgrade of resource manager 

- There are many updates in the resource manager. For details, please refer to [Resource Manager (New Version)](../../15-Resource Management/2.5-Resource Manager (New Version).md). 
- [Forward], [Back] and [Breadcrumb Navigation] functions allow you to quickly jump between parent and child directories

- Added [Simplified Mode] to provide a simpler and clearer resource classification method for developers who are not fully familiar with the file structure of Minecraft add-on packs.

- Optimized the search rules and added the [Filter] function. The search function supports penetrating searches of subfolders at all levels of the selected directory.

### Interface Editor Refactoring 

- There are many updates to the resource manager. For details, please refer to [Interface Editor Revision Notes](../../18-Interface and Interaction/0-Interface Editor Revision Notes.md). 
- The [parsing] ability and [compatibility] of the interface Json file are improved. Almost all legal interface Jsons can be parsed, and even if they cannot be parsed, your interface file will not be forced to be modified.

- All inherited controls can be expanded in the editor to display the [complete control structure]. For example, the following figure is the "switch" control built into the editor. You can now expand this control and learn its structure.

- Remove the old version of the inherited control function and replace it with [Inherit original control]. 

- Added the [Custom control] function. You can add a control (and sub-controls) to the control library, and reuse your custom control from the control library by simply dragging and dropping.
