### New File Wizard Centralized Optimization

- Interface presets and ScreenNode scripts always go hand in hand, especially for Blueprint developers. We have simplified the steps of using the interface through interface presets. Now when creating a new interface preset, you can choose to create and bind the ScreenNode script at the same time.
