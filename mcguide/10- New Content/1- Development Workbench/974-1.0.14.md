# 2022.9.28 Version 1.0.14 

## Debugging Tools 

We have launched a comprehensive upgrade of the debugging tools! The new version of the debugging tools improves the developer experience in the following processes: 

1. **Component synchronization**: When self-testing components, modify the component file on the PC side and synchronize it directly to the mobile test side, eliminating the long waiting time for machine review. 
2. **Multi-terminal log**: View the logs of the game tested on the computer and other devices on the computer, including the test logs of the mobile test client and other PC development kits. 
3. **Code debugging**: Use Python code to debug the ongoing game testing process directly, and provide code completion function. In addition, developers can view the debugging code history, and can save the written code as a shortcut command for easy reuse at any time. 

For more details about the new version of the debugging tool, please see [this document](../../30-Test/1-Use the debugging tool for mobile and computer debugging.md).
