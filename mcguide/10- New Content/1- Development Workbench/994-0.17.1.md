### New template: Cooking God Battle 

This is a gameplay map template for a complete game. It has a certain size and includes the comprehensive application of various systems. It is recommended to learn this template after learning the simple shooting template. It is currently recommended to use the old version of the editor to open this template for learning and testing. 

Cooking God Battle is a scoring cooking game. The map of the competition includes a preparation area, a central kitchen, and several resource areas. 
After the game starts, players need to kill monsters in the resource area to collect resources, and bring the resources back to the central kitchen to synthesize food to get points. 
The synthesis of food is achieved through custom recipes and has a permanent UI prompt. 
Cooking God Battle also includes some skills and props. 
The resource area will automatically refresh monsters and other resources according to the rules. If the player steps on the blocks in the farthest resource area, they will disappear within a few seconds. 
This template also includes a permanent mini-map that can display the positions of various players and creatures in real time. The mini-map also has an expansion function.
