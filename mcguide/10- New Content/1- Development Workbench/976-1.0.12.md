## Map Editor 

Now the map editor's brush material, fill, replace and other tools all support the selection of block status values! For details, please refer to [this document](../../14-Map Production/3-Block Status Value Setting Instructions.md). 

Open the corresponding window. If you select a block that can modify the status value, there will be a [Status Value Setting] option in the lower right corner after selecting it. Click it to expand the status value option. After adjusting the status value through the drop-down box, the block with the status value will be applied to the tool you are using.

> Note: Some special status values of some blocks can be found on the wiki, but when placing blocks, since the original block logic cannot take effect, we have blocked this part of the status value, and they will not be displayed in the status value setting options. 

## Special Effects Editor


### Special Effects Editor Timeline Update 

We have updated the timeline of the special effects editor. In addition to its appearance update, this update mainly includes the following features: 

1. Optimized the timeline's direct control of the delay of the Chinese version of the special effects. 
- Now developers can attach the same special effects file to different attachment points, and drag and modify the delay of specific special effects under each attachment point on the timeline.

> Note: The delay adjusted on the timeline will now be recorded in the special effects bind file and overwrite the delay in the original special effects file. If you want to continue to use the delay configured in the special effects file, please adjust it directly in the property panel instead of adjusting the handle on the timeline. 
> If you want to synchronize the delay data on the timeline to the special effects file itself, please click the [Synchronize File] button in the track properties window, so that the delay data on the timeline will be written to the special effects file configuration.

2. The left half of the special effect timeline window is changed to [hanging point name + special effect file name] to make the distinction between special effects clearer.

3. Skeleton model actions support hanging sound effects. 

> Note: The current version only supports original sound effects, and does not support manually added sound effects.
