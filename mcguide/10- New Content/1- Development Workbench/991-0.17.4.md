### Apollo Performance Optimization Tool 

We provide a script performance monitoring tool for server developers. You can select the server to monitor, and after monitoring for a period of time, you can obtain the flame graph of the script function calls during this period, and optimize the code according to the flame graph. For details, see [Performance Optimization Tips](../../27-网络游戏/课5：实用知识/第16：Performance Optimization Tips.md).

### Choose inheritance when creating parts 

When creating parts, you can choose to inherit built-in parts or other customized parts. 

Inheritance is object-oriented content. After using inheritance, in addition to the part code being inherited, the information of the part's property panel will also be inherited.

### The editor supports attaching preset parts from other AddOns 

As shown below, when editing a work, check the desired add-on package, and then you can use presets and parts from other AddOns when assembling presets. 

Other resources, such as pictures, materials, etc., are still not supported in the editor, but they are effective in the actual game.
