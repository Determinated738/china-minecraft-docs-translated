#### Stage 1: Understand the Developer Content Review System 

**Dear Developers:** 

We have officially established a new version of the "Developer Content Review System" to protect the rights and interests of each developer and provide players with a better gaming experience. The system was officially launched on January 18, 2021. The following is the complete content of the new version of the "Developer Content Review System": 



The developer system established by NetEase's "Minecraft" Chinese version is designed to protect the experience and information security of game players, especially "minor" players, while creating a healthy market environment for developers to help them show their creativity and gain profits. 



#### Content Security System 

NetEase's "Minecraft" Chinese version provides developers with a broad creative space, but political, pornographic, infringing or other illegal content seriously affects the game experience and physical and mental health of players, and threatens the creative freedom of other developers; before developing and submitting resources, please be sure to avoid violating the following content:

#### Content listing requirements 

In order to ensure the quality of platform content and promote the healthy development of the developer ecosystem, the content listed on the Chinese version of NetEase's "Minecraft" must meet the following content itself, content materials, and pricing requirements: 

#### Basic content requirements 

**Strictly check content that affects balance** 
The review of content that will seriously affect the functional balance, such as mine penetration, permanent night vision, and too many transparent parts of the skin, will be more stringent. 
**Confirm basic functional guarantees** 
Please use the developer tool for self-testing, and upload only after confirmation to ensure the normal operation of components/map content/add and other resources, and at the same time ensure that textures, skins, etc. are displayed normally and completely, and there are no language barriers. 



#### Bad material representation 

Content materials are an important way for players to understand the content itself. The following situations are considered as bad material representation: 
**False advertising:** 

The relevant materials are not described truthfully, the important real situation of the current content is concealed, or there is a situation where the promotion is inconsistent with the current actual content status, or the promotion is updated and iterated content later. 

**Traffic outflow:** 

Without permission, the use of external inducement content including but not limited to QQ, WeChat, Weibo, QR code, external links, live broadcast platforms, rental service promotion, offline transaction content, etc. 

**Malicious inducement:** 

Suspected malicious inducement behaviors including but not limited to purchase gifts, red envelopes for good reviews, and sharing fission appear. 

**Low originality:** 

The material uses too many original textures, or is similar to existing components of the same type, and lacks originality and functionality.

Except for "free content", the minimum price and discounted price of content within 90 days before launch shall not be lower than the following standards: 



| Content type | Diamond pricing | 
| ---------- | -------- | 
| Map, appearance | 50 diamonds | 
| Light and shadow, gameplay | 100 diamonds |

#### Original protection system 

In order to maintain the healthy development of the developer ecosystem, NetEase's "Minecraft" Chinese version will spare no effort to protect original content and resolutely crack down on all kinds of infringements on the rights and interests of others. There are two major system regulations for original protection: 




#### Original content protection regulations 

The developer component code and the developer's first original content in the content (including character image design, scene design, art style design, etc.) are the developer's original content, and other developers are not allowed to plagiarize in any form. 

#### Original material protection regulations 

The developer's first original content in the content material, including introduction videos, introduction pictures, content names, content descriptions, content keywords, etc., are the developer's original materials. If they are identical or overly similar to the original materials, it is a violation of the original material protection regulations. 
For punishment and reporting methods, please see [【Punishment and Reporting】](#Punishment and Reporting) below.

Developers who violate the developer content review system will be punished according to [【Punishment Processing Strength】](#Punishment Processing Strength); if it is found that the developer has violated the content review system or infringed, it can be reported through the reporting function of NetEase Minecraft mobile game or PC game client.
