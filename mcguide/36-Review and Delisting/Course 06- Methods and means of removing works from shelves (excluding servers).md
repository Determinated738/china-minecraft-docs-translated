The component will then return to the "Unreviewed" page, and the resource needs to be reviewed again. 

After waiting for the review to pass, click "Weakly Removed" on the "Reviewed" page, and the component will be officially weakly removed successfully.

Note: Weak removal means that after the operation, the content cannot be searched, viewed or purchased by users 

But the players who have already constructed the content can still use it normally
